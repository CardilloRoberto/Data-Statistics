# Statistical Analysis Toolkit

## Overview

The **Statistical Analysis Toolkit** is a comprehensive project designed to perform various statistical analyses and support data-driven decision-making. This repository includes an Excel file containing a collection of statistical tools, formulas, and results for common and advanced statistical methods.

## Features

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize and visualize data characteristics.
- **Frequency Tables**: Analyze the distribution of categorical variables.
- **Probability Distributions**:
  - Binomial
  - Poisson
  - Normal
  - Chi-Square, t-Student, and F-Snedecor
- **Correlation and Association Tests**:
  - Chi-Square Association
  - Pearson Correlation
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Z-Test, t-Test, Chi-Square Test, and F-Test
  - Confidence intervals for mean
- **Two-Sample Comparisons**: Perform t-tests for independent samples.

## File Structure

The primary resource in this repository is the Excel file: **Statistics.xlsx**, which contains the following sheets:

| Sheet Name                         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS             | Summary of key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.        |
| Frequency Table                    | Tables to understand distributions of categorical data.                     |
| Relationship Between Variables     | Tools for exploring associations between variables.                         |
| Pearson Correlation                | Compute correlation coefficients for variables.                             |
| Probability Distributions          | Evaluate common probability distributions such as Binomial and Poisson.     |
| Hypothesis Testing                 | Perform hypothesis tests including Z-Tests, t-Tests, and Chi-Square Tests.  |
| Confidence Interval - Mean         | Confidence interval estimations for population means.                       |

## Installation

To use this project, you will need:

1. **Microsoft Excel** or equivalent software to open `.xlsx` files.
2. (Optional) **Python** with `pandas` for programmatically accessing the data.
